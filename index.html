<h1>Welcome to future PC Archives.</h1>
<p>This site is written in plain HTML with addition of a little js coding. But why you even care to do it? Well... I'm tired of these 'new', 'modern' technologies wich didn't do job well and take care of your system stability.
The project is itself developed for obsolete systems, obsolete projects, obsolete ideas and for a proper place for it.</p>
<p>You should find a place here where you could play old games multiplayer with your friends, post your project (cheer winprj - your ideas was awesome), 
find useful files - like drivers to your obsolete PC/Laptop or just docs for your electronic projects (I had 20GB of just pdf's)</p>
<p>Do you have a story you would care to share? Want to help me with this (I'm such a noob...) Mail me at pmache@zoho.com</p>
